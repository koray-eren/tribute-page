                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ul id="flex-list">
                    <li>American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed the Green Revolution</li>
                    <li>Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal</li>
                    <li>Borlaug was often called "the father of the Green Revolution", and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation</li>
                    <li>He developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties. During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those nations</li>
